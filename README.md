**Project Title and Description:**
The title of our project will be Random Number Memory Game. 
The effective use of our project will be to see how many numbers a player/person can remember in the correct order. The way we will achieve this is by making a webpage with a random number that’ll pop up for a limited time interval as well as a place where the player can input the number once it disappears. After every successful completion of a level of the game, the number becomes larger and larger (increasing difficulty). The decision of which number to guess by the program will be generated randomly and stored so it can continue the pattern (it will reset every time the game is lost). The game goes on for infinity. As a result, if the player loses they get to see their high score as well as a reset button.

**Functional Requirements:**
When the app is opened, you will be shown a main menu with a large “start”, “best score”, and “settings” buttons.
A start button is located in the main menu and takes you to the game screen when tapped.
A retry button is located on the top right corner of the screen and restarts the game when clicked (only visible if you’ve already started the game).
A quit/exit button is located to the right of the retry button and allows the user to leave the game without saving any progress (only visible if you’ve already started the game). 
A function is needed to enter a number when the start number is tapped.
A function is needed to generate a random number that’s one digit longer than the last one by the app.
A function is needed to make the game generate a random number.
Must create a leaderboard.
Inputting a name into the leaderboard after the game.
Must store the input in the leaderboard.
An error warning appears if no username is entered into the leaderboard textbox.
A main menu button is located to the bottom right corner after viewing the leaderboard.
A button to a rules page is displayed to the left of the retry button.
